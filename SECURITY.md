# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Since we don't really do versioning, only the latest master is ever somewhat supported.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability, please get a maintainer's attention on the [Telegram Support Group](https://t.me/PokeParkSupport)
and report it to them privately in a direct message. They will open a draft advisory that will be published when a fixed version is out.
You will be contacted on Telegram if further information is needed or if the report is not accepted.
