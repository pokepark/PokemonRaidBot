Basic installation
==================

There is no central bot and every community runs their own. While this means installation is quite involved, it also provides you maximum flexibility and features.

We recommend Docker for novice admins since it's the most controlled environment but it also still has many pitfalls associated. The `full documentation <https://pokemonraidbot.readthedocs.io>`_ has more installation options including fully manual into any LAMP webhosting solution.
